# First Unit Tests

This repo will help you get started learning how to create functional code,
based on feedback that you're getting from tests. In the future, you'll be
writing your own tests, but for today, you just need to run the tests that have
already been written for you, and implement code to make them pass.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:solidkraft/first-unit-tests.git`  
CD into the directory: `cd first-unit-tests`  
Install dependencies: `npm install`  
Run the tests: `npm test`  
Make them pass!
